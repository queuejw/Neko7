# Neko7
Neko7 is a joke game about collecting cats, based on an easter egg from Android Nougat. It was created for a fool's day prank in my main project Neko11. 
Is compatible with Neko11 and you can safely play both versions without losing progress. 
## How to play
To start the game:
1. Add Neko7 to the "notification drawer" (where Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc. are located).

OR

1. Open the app, then open the menu and tap Dish.

2. Select your favorite food and close the app. You will receive a notification when the kitty comes.

Enjoy the game!
